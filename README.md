1.	College Database Management 

Overview – This project involves working with a college database containing details of students, professors, enrolments, departments, and courses. SQL queries were used to extract data based on specific requirements, along with the creation of stored procedures, triggers, and events to enhance database functionality.

Functions Used – Joins, Stored Procedures, Triggers and Events

Description – 
•	Executed SQL queries to retrieve required data, such as details of students, professors, courses, and their associations with departments. 
•	Utilized Joins to combine data from multiple tables, such as linking students and professors with their respective departments and courses. 
•	Developed Stored Procedures to automate repetitive tasks, such as adding or updating student and professor records efficiently. 
•	Implemented Before and After Triggers to automatically log changes when a new student or professor is enrolled or updated in the database. 
•	Created an Event Scheduler to handle expiring enrollments, ensuring that outdated records are managed systematically.
